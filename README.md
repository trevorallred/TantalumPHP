Tantalum
========

Tantalum is an open source, PHP based web application builder that allows business analysts to rapidly create and deploy fully functional enterprise web applications.

It is inspired by the work done by [TenFold Corporation](http://www.tenfold.com/) in the 1990s and Microsoft Access. Think of Tantalum as a web-based version of Microsoft Access.
